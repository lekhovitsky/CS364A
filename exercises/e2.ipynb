    "According to the Myerson's lemma, our design space consists of a single allocation that always awards the good to the highest bidder. In all other allocations, increasing the bid might lead to losing the auction, which breaks monotonicity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we know that there is a unique payment rule that implements this allocation, and it is explicitly given by the formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_i(b_i, \\mathbf{b}_{-i}) = \\sum_{j=1}^l z_j \\left( x_i(z_j + 0, \\mathbf{b}_{-i}) - x_i(z_j, \\mathbf{b}_{-i}) \\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In our case, $x_i$ has only one jump at $z_j$ equal to the second highest price (let's call it $B$), and the size of the jump equals 1 (from not winning the good to winning one unit of the good).\n",
    "\n",
    "For $b_i>B$  the sum above consists of just one summand and gives $p_i(b_i, \\mathbf{b}_{-i}) = B \\cdot 1 = B$. For $b_i < B$ the sum doesn't consist of any summands so $p_i(b_i, \\mathbf{b_i}) = 0$. Combining this payment rule with the allocation rule described above, we get the Vickrey auction. Thus, it is the only auction that is DSIC, awards the good to the highest bidder, and charges losers 0."
